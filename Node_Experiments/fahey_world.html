                <div id="left_side_bar_details_body">The presence of invasive weeds is highly problematic for conservation managers. They can rapidly spread and displace native species, and once the character of a grassland ecosystem is altered it can take several generations to restore. Native to southeast Russia, and a member of the mustard family, Dyer’s woad (Isatis tinctoria) was first introduced to the United States in the early 1900s through contaminated alfalfa seed. Listed as a noxious and highly invasive weed in 11 western states, its presence in Montana is currently limited to roughly 400 acres which makes its eradication of utmost priority. Montana’s largest and oldest Dyer’s woad population spans some 200 acres on Missoula’s Mount Sentinel. The Montana Dyer’s Woad Cooperative Project task Force has been trying to eradicate it from this beloved open space for the past 14 years.
    With the potential to generate up to 10,000 seeds per plant, locating and hand pulling a woad before it goes to flower or seed is key to containment. In collaboration with the University of Montana, Montana State University, the City of Missoula, Missoula County Weed District and the Montana Native Plant Society, WDC dog-led teams have been working hard over the last two seasons to find Dyer’s woad, and remove every individual plant.</div>

                <div id="left_side_bar_details_effects_details">2011: Dog teams found pre-emergent plants and sprouting root remnants – providing first-ever proof that Dyer’s woad could re-sprout after pulling.  This led our partners to switch to more effective removal methods.
<br><br> 2012: 42% of all plants located were first missed by humans but were subsequently found by dogs. More importantly, most plants are now found BEFORE they reproduce.
