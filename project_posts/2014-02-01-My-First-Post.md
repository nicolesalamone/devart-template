Analog inspiration from earlier works

I have been working around this idea for many years in both analog and digital forms.  In 2004 I created The Human Pixel Project (HPP.)  The HPP was a hybrid project in which I solicited artist via Craigslist to each give me 10 paintings, executed on 2x2 inch tiles which I mailed to them, along with a brief essay on art and a check for return postage.  The project went viral I acquired over 22,000 tiles, from thousands of artists all over the world by the projects completion.

The notion of 'The human pixel' struck me as humble and democratic.  It also struck me as a way to address issues of authorship and ownership in art as well as the increasing connectedness of people enabled by the Internet.  

Other projects:  Abu Grhaib Toys.  Yellowstone Park random picture engine (via Flickr)  String Walk.  $1000. Themes of technology, connectedness, questions about craft vs. concept, authorship, ownership, copyright.
