(EDIT IN PROGRESS -- INCOMPLETE)

I have been working around this idea for many years in both analog and digital forms.  In 2004 I created The Human Pixel Project (HPP.)  The HPP was a hybrid project in which I solicited artist via Craigslist to each give me 10 paintings, executed on 2x2 inch tiles which I mailed to them, along with a brief essay on art and a check for return postage.  The project went viral and at the time of completion I had collected over 22,000 paintings from thousands of artists all over the world. The work was shown in various forms in Boston, Miami and Los Angeles as well as online.

The notion of 'The human pixel' struck me then as humble and democratic, and a way of addressing an art world that has often been too focused on the heroic creator/genius and his/her fetishized objects.  It was also a way to address issues of authorship and ownership in the digital age, the increasing connectedness (created 2004) of people enabled by the Internet, and honestly my then frustration with making traditional 'art' objects.  The old models of art seemed tired to me and it was an effort push at the edges.  

Other projects:  Abu Grhaib Toys.  Yellowstone Park random picture engine (via Flickr)  String Walk.  $1000. Themes of technology, connectedness, questions about craft vs. concept, authorship, ownership, copyright.
